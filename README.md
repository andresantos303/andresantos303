I’ve worked on real-world projects using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB – with a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end workflows. Through academic and part-time professional experiences, I’ve contributed to app development, API creation, WordPress content management, and even assisted in preparing presentations for programming workshops. I'm proactive, enjoy working in collaborative environments, and have strong communication skills.
